<h3>Context</h3>
    <p>On 25th November 1970, the nationalist Yukio Mishima and his compatriots stormed a military headquarter, attempting to start a coup to reinstate the emperor as the supreme leader of Japan. He was appalled by the decadence of Japanese culture, believing that Western influence is turning the once patriotic and honorable Japan into a materialistic society. Standing in front of thousands of soldiers, Mishima urged the military to turn their back on Japan’s post-World War Two constitution and return modern-day Japan back to its glory days of samurai ethics. 
</p><p>
    He was, however, greeted by boos and jeers. Dejected, he went back into the building and committed seppuku, which is the traditional Japanese method of suicide.

<p>
    Right before his death, Mishima had just completed writing his novel, “The Decay of an angel”, which was the final book of his Sea of Fertility tetralogy. Considered the magnum opus of his writing career, the tetralogy is a perfect summation of his life and his beliefs, and also a good historical blueprint of Japanese culture from the 1910s to 1970.
</p>
<h3>Spring Snow</h3>
<p>
    Spring Snow, which is the first book in the Sea of Fertility tetralogy, is a love story between Kiyoaki Matusugae and Satoko Ayakura. The story follows Kiyaoki, an elegant yet self-centered young man as he struggles with his feelings towards his spirited childhood friend Satoko. His feelings towards Satoko swing ferociously, from deep hatred to love, and finally climaxes when they cannot be together due to extraneous circumstances. It is written like a Romeo Juliet type of story, perhaps deliberately, where two star-crossed lovers head towards tragedy due to their forbidden love.
</p><p>
    Despite it being a romance story, the novel does expound on Mishima’s political beliefs. Taking place right after the Meiji Era, the cultural shift of Japan is a major theme in the novel, as well as the tension between the East and the West. Mishima depicts the western-influenced Japanese as rich but unrefined. The appearance of Baron Shinkawa and his wife was an especially memorable scene for me, as Mishima portrays them as comically tasteless and annoying. The scene was reminiscent of the ballroom scene in Pygmalion.
</p><p>
    While such themes are an important aspect of the novel, I do enjoy other aspects of the novel more. One such aspect is the love story between Kiyoaki and Satoko.
</p>
    <h3>Romance</h3>
    
    <p>The romance between Kiyoaki and Satoko is the beating heart of the novel. Though simple and straightforward, it is beautifully written and well-executed. The mind games between Kiyoaki and Satoko were enjoyable and the ever-present tension between the two lovers kept me on edge. One of my favourite lines of the novel is a metaphor used by Satoko to describe the inevitable end of their relationship, which I thought is really poetic. 
        </p><blockquote>“The path we’re taking is not a road, Kiyo, it’s a pier, and it ends someplace where the sea begins. It can’t be helped.” </blockquote>
    <p>Unlike Romeo and Juliet who are unable to be together due to the feud between the two families, Kiyoaki himself is often the obstacle in his relationship with Satoko. Crude, prideful and moody, he changes his outlook towards Satoko on a whim, sabotaging his own relationship in order to protect his ego. As Mishima describes, there is a <q>hidden, savage essence of the elegance he had cultivated</q> in him. It is only when Satoko becomes unattainable that he finally pursues her wholeheartedly. His temperamental feeling is thus ironically his own downfall. 
    </p>    <blockquote>"His own heart seemed to him to be much like an arrow stripped of the flashing white feathers that gave it direction."</blockquote>
    
    <h3>Kiyoaki and Mishima</h3>
    <p>
    The only thing that is ever consistent about Kiyoaki is his elegance and it is something that he seems to pride himself in. This elegance, however, has a destructive tendency to it. Kiyoaki perhaps symbolises Japanese culture itself. In an interview, Mishima spoke about what he saw as two “contradictory characteristics” of the Japanese: elegance and brutality. He said: “The two characteristics are very tightly combined, sometimes, and the brutality I think comes from our emotions. The elegance comes from our nervous side, and sometimes we are too sensitive about defining elegance or sense of beauty.” This very contradiction seems to define Kiyoaki, and his eventual downfall, while tragic and self-inflicting, is depicted as something courageous and elegant.
    </p>
    <blockquote>“There's no doubt that he's heading straight for tragedy. It will be beautiful, of course, but should he throw his whole life away as a sacrificial offering to such a fleeting beauty--like a bird in flight glimpsed from a window?”</blockquote>
    <p>
    Perhaps, like Kiyoaki, Mishima is self-aware that his attempted coup would be futile, and that he too would be heading straight towards tragedy. In fact, Mishima planned for his own seppuku, even making his intentions of suicide known. </p>
    <p>Yet, he still carried on with the pursuit of the unattainable. Steadfast in his beliefs, Mishima would rather commit seppuku to send a message instead of admitting defeat. 
</p><p>
    This begs the question, whether Mishima’s actions (and Kiyoaki’s actions(no spoilers))  are justifiable and respectable. Should he throw his whole life away as a sacrificial offering to his beliefs? Especially for a belief that is so controversial?
</p><p>One can certainly argue that Mishima is merely the opposite side of the same coin as Thích Quảng Đức, the Buddhist monk who set himself on fire during the Vietnam War just seven years before Mishima. Both Mishima and Thích Quảng Đức died for a cause greater than themselves and were unflinching in their sacrifice. 
</p>

<p>That said, one could also argue that Mishima is the opposite side of the same coin as the Japanese soldiers who committed kamikaze during World War Two. While their acts are, in some aspects honorable, they are also brutal and barbaric.
</p><p>As Yukio Mishima writes in his jisei (meaning death poem), he certainly believed that his sacrifice is worth it. To him, his act of seppuku is an act of duty, an essence of himself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>A small night storm blows/ <br> Saying “Falling is the essence of a flower”/ <br> Preceding those who hesitate.</blockquote>
    
    <h3>Writing Style</h3>
    <p>Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima is the most poetic novel I’ve ever read. Written intricately, Spring Snow is filled with flowing passages of beautiful allegories and metaphors. Like a painter waving his brush, Mishima generously world builds, giving each scene memorable luscious descriptions. His ability to depict the most mundane of things in a poetic manner is unparalleled. Here, he depicts a scene at the beach, where Kiyoaki is looking at the rising and falling of tides.
    </p>
    <blockquote> “The sea, broad and vast, with all its mighty force, ended right there before his eyes. Be it the edge of time or space, there is nothing so awe-inspiring as a border. [...] As he watched the final surge of each wave as it drained into the sand, the final thrust of mighty power that had come down through countless centuries, he was struck by the pathos of it all. At that very point, a grand pan-oceanic enterprise that spanned the world went awry and ended in annihilation. But still, he thought, this final frustration was a gentle, soothing one. A small, lacy frill, the wave’s last farewell, escaped from disintegration at the last moment before merging into the glistening wet sand as the wave itself withdrew, and vanished into the sea.”</blockquote>
  
    <p>
    This, while being one of Mishima’s greatest strengths, can also be seen as his greatest weakness as well. While gorgeously written, Mishima’s writing style can be hard to read and understand. His long descriptive passages can be a put-off, as they can often disrupt the pacing of the novel and drag it out for much longer than it needs to be.</p>
    <p> I remember instances where Mishima would start describing certain things that doesn’t seem to be of much importance. For instance, he started describing a folding screen for almost an entire page. While there might have been some thematic significance that I did not manage to pick up on, his descriptions disrupted the tension that was built up in the scene. 
</p><p>
    Thus, I can see Mishima’s writing as pretty polarising for readers. Mishima’s writing style would suit readers who enjoy slow books that take their time to world build and immerse their readers into every thought and scene of the novel. For readers who enjoy faster-paced stories with exciting plots, Spring Snow can be a drag and a turn-of. 
    </p>
    <h3>Philosophical discussions</h3>
    <p>However, one thing that I did enjoy and I think most people would enjoy is Spring Snow’s philosophical discussions. Honda, who is depicted as a very rational and smart individual, is often involved in such discussions, which is why he is one of my favourite characters in the novels. He discussed things like history, the nature of law, and reincarnations, which I found immensely interesting. 
    </p><p>
    As someone that is interested in political science, the passage about natural law really intrigued me. It was an acute observation that I thought is worth sharing. Honda explains:
    </p>
    <blockquote> “[On Law of Manu] Here, just as in the natural law, to observe the law and to do good deeds were taken as being the same thing. But here the law was based upon the principle of the transmigration of souls, a doctrine that short-circuited normal rational inquiry. And rather than making an appeal to human reason, the Laws seemed to play on the threat of retribution. And thus as a doctrine of law, it placed somewhat less trust in human nature than did the Roman law with its reliance on the powers of reason.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>Reincarnation is a surprisingly major theme in the novel and the tetralogy, as Mishima goes in-depth in describing and analysing the Buddhist ideas of reincarnation. While I personally believe that reincarnation is pure wishful thinking, It is fun to dabble with the possibility of it. Mishima also borrows many other ideas and stories from Buddhism, which I thought was interesting and unexpected.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
    Being only the third ever Japanese literature I’ve read, Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima definitely made me want to read more Japanese literature. It is certainly a novel written by a one-of-a-kind author.
</p><p>
    That said, it is not without its flaws. As mentioned above, Mishima’s writing style can be hard to read, and the plot is rather slow. This makes the novel rather dense. The pacing of the novel is not the best, and the ending feels incomplete. This, however, can be forgiven as it is after all the first book of a tetralogy. 
</p><p>
    Nevertheless, it is hard to find another novel that is as captivating as Spring Snow. Mishima's writing alone makes me want to reread it some day. (But perhaps not anytime soon because it is rather difficult to read) 
    <p>All in all I would rate Spring Snow 8/10. I do recommend this novel for anyone who is interested in Japanese culture or anyone that is looking for a challenge and hoping to read something dense yet poetic. I will definitely read the second novel in the tetralogy, Runaway Horses, someday.
